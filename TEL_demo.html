      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This project was inspired by the Tokyo Robotics Contest 2024, where the goal was to design a mobile robot capable of 
        continuously launching frisbees into target baskets of varying heights (140 cm, 180 cm, and 220 cm). 
        The robot was designed with omni-directional mobility, automatic frisbee feeding, and reliable frisbee shooting. 
        Post-competition improvements focused on control systems and computer vision integration.

      <h2>Mechanical Design</h2>
      <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 70 × 70 × 80 cm | <strong>Weight:</strong> 45 kg | <strong>Frisbee Capacity:</strong> 20</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chassis:</strong> Aluminum extrusion frame with mecanum wheels for omni-directional movement. Motors with encoders provided closed-loop speed control.</li>
        <li><strong>Launching Track:</strong> A 45° angled track with rollers and rubber strips to provide spin and forward thrust. Driven by a CIM motor with servo-assisted feeding.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage & Feeding:</strong> Dual-barrel storage with a V-shaped feeder and spiral 3D-printed parts to ensure precise frisbee delivery into the launcher.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>System Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The robot integrates multiple subsystems coordinated by Jetson Nano, Arduino microcontrollers, and wireless control modules.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vision System:</strong> Stereo camera setup for frisbee and basket detection, powered by YOLOv5 and stereo depth estimation.</li>
        <li><strong>Feeding & Launching:</strong> Servo and DC motors with encoders, controlled via L298N and BTS7960 drivers.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Mecanum wheels driven by DC motors, with IMU-based orientation correction.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Control:</strong> AT9S remote and R9DS receiver using SBUS protocol, connected to Arduino for execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Signal Flow:</strong> Jetson Nano handles vision and trajectory prediction; Arduino executes motor commands and feedback control.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Communication System</h2>
      <p>
        SBUS protocol was selected over PWM for communication due to higher efficiency, multi-channel support, and minimal interference. 
        An inverter circuit was added to handle SBUS signal inversion for Arduino processing.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Control System</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chassis Speed Control:</strong> Encoder feedback with error compensation ensured stable wheel synchronization.</li>
        <li><strong>Feeding Mechanism:</strong> Encoder-based DC motors allowed precise spiral rotation to release frisbees without jamming.</li>
        <li><strong>Orientation Correction:</strong> IMU (BNO055) calibration reduced drift to 0.1° over 20 minutes of operation.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Regulation:</strong> Voltage monitoring adjusted PWM outputs to maintain stable power supply for motors.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Vision System</h2>
      <p>
        The vision system employed stereo cameras and YOLOv5 detection to identify frisbees and baskets, followed by depth estimation 
        and 3D trajectory fitting. An LSTM-based model was trained to predict frisbee flight paths using Z-axis (height) data, achieving 
        prediction accuracy within ±10 cm under real test conditions.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Key Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reliable SBUS communication improved efficiency and reduced interference compared to PWM.</li>
        <li>Wheel speed synchronization enhanced stability and precision in movement.</li>
        <li>Vision-guided launching reduced trial-and-error and improved shooting accuracy.</li>
        <li>LSTM trajectory prediction demonstrated potential for intelligent aiming in dynamic environments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This project successfully integrated mechanical design, control systems, and vision-based trajectory prediction to build a 
        cost-effective frisbee-launching robot. Through continuous experimentation and optimization, the team achieved competition goals 
        and gained hands-on experience in robotics integration, vision systems, and control design.
